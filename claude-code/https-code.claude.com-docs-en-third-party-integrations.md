Access Claude models via Google Cloud Platform with enterprise-grade security and compliance](/docs/en/google-vertex-ai)[## Microsoft Foundry

Access Claude through Azure with API key or Microsoft Entra ID authentication and Azure billing](/docs/en/microsoft-foundry)

## [​](#corporate-infrastructure) Corporate infrastructure

[## Enterprise Network

Deploy centralized model access with usage tracking, budgeting, and audit logging](/docs/en/llm-gateway)

## [​](#configuration-overview) Configuration overview

Claude Code supports flexible configuration options that allow you to combine different providers and infrastructure:

Understand the difference between:

* **Corporate proxy**: An HTTP/HTTPS proxy for routing traffic (set via `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY`)
* **LLM Gateway**: A service that handles authentication and provides provider-compatible endpoints (set via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL`, or `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL`)

Both configurations can be used in tandem.

### [​](#using-bedrock-with-corporate-proxy) Using Bedrock with corporate proxy

Route Bedrock traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Enable Bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Configure corporate proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
```

### [​](#using-bedrock-with-llm-gateway) Using Bedrock with LLM Gateway

Use a gateway service that provides Bedrock-compatible endpoints:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Enable Bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1

# Configure LLM gateway
export ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com/bedrock'
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles AWS auth
```

### [​](#using-foundry-with-corporate-proxy) Using Foundry with corporate proxy

Route Azure traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Enable Microsoft Foundry
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1
export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_RESOURCE=your-resource
export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_API_KEY=your-api-key  # Or omit for Entra ID auth

# Configure corporate proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
```

### [​](#using-foundry-with-llm-gateway) Using Foundry with LLM Gateway

Use a gateway service that provides Azure-compatible endpoints:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Enable Microsoft Foundry
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1

# Configure LLM gateway
export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com'
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_FOUNDRY_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles Azure auth
```

### [​](#using-vertex-ai-with-corporate-proxy) Using Vertex AI with corporate proxy

Route Vertex AI traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Enable Vertex
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# Configure corporate proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
```

### [​](#using-vertex-ai-with-llm-gateway) Using Vertex AI with LLM Gateway

Combine Google Vertex AI models with an LLM gateway for centralized management:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Enable Vertex
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1

# Configure LLM gateway
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com/vertex'
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles GCP auth
```

### [​](#authentication-configuration) Authentication configuration

Claude Code uses the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` for the `Authorization` header when needed. The `SKIP_AUTH` flags (`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH`) are used in LLM gateway scenarios where the gateway handles provider authentication.

## [​](#choosing-the-right-deployment-configuration) Choosing the right deployment configuration

Consider these factors when selecting your deployment approach:

### [​](#direct-provider-access) Direct provider access

Best for organizations that:

* Want the simplest setup
* Have existing AWS or GCP infrastructure
* Need provider-native monitoring and compliance

### [​](#corporate-proxy) Corporate proxy

Best for organizations that:

* Have existing corporate proxy requirements
* Need traffic monitoring and compliance
* Must route all traffic through specific network paths

### [​](#llm-gateway) LLM Gateway

Best for organizations that:

* Need usage tracking across teams
* Want to dynamically switch between models
* Require custom rate limiting or budgets
* Need centralized authentication management

## [​](#debugging) Debugging

When debugging your deployment:

* Use the `claude /status` [slash command](/docs/en/slash-commands). This command provides observability into any applied authentication, proxy, and URL settings.
* Set environment variable `export ANTHROPIC_LOG=debug` to log requests.

## [​](#best-practices-for-organizations) Best practices for organizations

### [​](#1-invest-in-documentation-and-memory) 1. Invest in documentation and memory

We strongly recommend investing in documentation so that Claude Code understands your codebase. Organizations can deploy CLAUDE.md files at multiple levels:

* **Organization-wide**: Deploy to system directories like `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md` (macOS) for company-wide standards
* **Repository-level**: Create `CLAUDE.md` files in repository roots containing project architecture, build commands, and contribution guidelines. Check these into source control so all users benefit
  [Learn more](/docs/en/memory).

### [​](#2-simplify-deployment) 2. Simplify deployment

If you have a custom development environment, we find that creating a “one click” way to install Claude Code is key to growing adoption across an organization.

### [​](#3-start-with-guided-usage) 3. Start with guided usage

Encourage new users to try Claude Code for codebase Q&A, or on smaller bug fixes or feature requests. Ask Claude Code to make a plan. Check Claude’s suggestions and give feedback if it’s off-track. Over time, as users understand this new paradigm better, then they’ll be more effective at letting Claude Code run more agentically.

### [​](#4-configure-security-policies) 4. Configure security policies

Security teams can configure managed permissions for what Claude Code is and is not allowed to do, which cannot be overwritten by local configuration. [Learn more](/docs/en/security).

### [​](#5-leverage-mcp-for-integrations) 5. Leverage MCP for integrations

MCP is a great way to give Claude Code more information, such as connecting to ticket management systems or error logs. We recommend that one central team configures MCP servers and checks a `.mcp.json` configuration into the codebase so that all users benefit. [Learn more](/docs/en/mcp).
At Anthropic, we trust Claude Code to power development across every Anthropic codebase. We hope you enjoy using Claude Code as much as we do!

## [​](#next-steps) Next steps
