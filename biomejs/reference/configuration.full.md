# Configuration

## `$schema`

[Section titled “$schema”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#schema)

Allows to pass a path to a JSON schema file.

We publish a JSON schema file for our `biome.json`/`biome.jsonc` files.

You can specify a relative path to the schema inside the `@biomejs/biome` NPM
package if it is installed in the `node_modules` folder:

```
{

  "$schema": "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/configuration_schema.json"

}
```

If you have problems with resolving the physical file, you can use the one
published on this site:

```
{

  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/2.0.5/schema.json"

}
```

## `extends`

[Section titled “extends”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#extends)

A list of paths to other Biome configuration files. Biome resolves and applies
the configuration settings from the files contained in the `extends` list, and
eventually applies the options contained in this `biome.json`/`biome.jsonc`
file.

The order of paths to extend goes from least relevant to most relevant.

Since v2, this option accepts a string that must match the value `"//"`, which can be used
when setting up [monorepos](https://biomejs.dev/guides/big-projects#monorepo)

## `root`

[Section titled “root”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#root)

Whether this configuration should be treated as a root. By default, any configuration file is considered a root by default.
When a configuration file is a “nested configuration”, it must set `"root": false`, otherwise an error is thrown.

This is required so Biome can orchestrate multiple files in CLI and editors at the same time.

> Default: `true`

## `files`

[Section titled “files”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#files)

### `files.includes`

[Section titled “files.includes”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesincludes)

A list of [glob patterns](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#glob-syntax-reference) of files to process.

If a folder matches a glob pattern, all files inside that folder will be
processed.

The following example matches all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```
{

  "files": {

    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]

  }

}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern. When using a negated pattern, you
should always specify `**` first to match all files and folders, otherwise
the negated pattern will not match any files.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```
{

  "files": {

    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js", "!test"]

  }

}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are processed, thanks to the `**` pattern…
2. … _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension…
3. … but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still processed…
4. … _except_ when it occurs in the folder named `test`, because _no_ files
inside that folder are processed.

This means that:

- `src/app.js` **is** processed.
- `src/app.test.js` **is not** processed.
- `src/special.test.js` **is** processed.
- `test/special.test.js` **is not** processed.

Note that files inside `node_modules/` are ignored regardless of the
`files.includes` setting.

#### Interaction with the scanner

[Section titled “Interaction with the scanner”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#interaction-with-the-scanner)

Biome has a [scanner](https://biomejs.dev/internals/architecture/#scanner) that is responsible for
discovering nested configuration files as well as `.gitignore` files. It can
also index source files if one or more rules from the
[project domain](https://biomejs.dev/linter/domains/#project) are enabled.

The scanner respects both `files.includes` and the ignored patterns from
`.gitignore` files, but there are two exceptions to be aware of:

- Special files such as `biome.json` and `.gitignore` take priority over any
ignored patterns in `files.includes`.
- If any rule from the project domain is enabled, the scanner will index source
files _including their dependencies_. This means that files that are ignored
as part of `files.includes` may still get indexed by the scanner, as long as
there is another included file that imports those files. And this also
means that `.d.ts` files and `package.json` manifests inside `node_modules/`
may still get indexed too.

If you want to explicitly force some files to be ignored by the scanner, you can
do so using a so-called _force-ignore pattern_. A force-ignore pattern looks
like a regular negated pattern, but starts with a double exclamation mark
(`!!`).

For example, you can tell Biome to never look inside any `dist/` folder using
the following configuration:

```
{

  "files": {

    "includes": ["**", "!!**/dist"]

  }

}
```

We recommend using the force-ignore syntax for any folders that contain _output_
files, such as `build/` and `dist/`. For such folders, it is highly unlikely
that indexing has any useful benefits. For folders containing generated files,
we advise using regular ignore patterns so that type information can still be
extracted from the files.

For nested `biome.json` files as well as `.gitignore` files that you wish to
explicitly ignore, the force-ignore syntax must also be used.

### `files.ignoreUnknown`

[Section titled “files.ignoreUnknown”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesignoreunknown)

If `true`, Biome won’t emit diagnostics if it encounters files that it can’t
handle.

```
{

  "files": {

    "ignoreUnknown": true

  }

}
```

> Default: `false`

### `files.maxSize`

[Section titled “files.maxSize”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesmaxsize)

The maximum allowed size for source code files in bytes. Files above
this limit will be ignored for performance reasons.

> Default: `1048576` (1024\*1024, 1MB)

### `files.experimentalScannerIgnores`

[Section titled “files.experimentalScannerIgnores”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesexperimentalscannerignores)

An array of literal path segments that the scanner should ignore during the
crawling. The ignored files won’t be indexed, which means that these files won’t
be part of the module graph, and types won’t be inferred from them.

## `vcs`

[Section titled “vcs”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#vcs)

Set of properties to integrate Biome with a VCS (Version Control Software).

### `vcs.enabled`

[Section titled “vcs.enabled”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#vcsenabled)

Whether Biome should integrate itself with the VCS client

> Default: `false`

### `vcs.clientKind`

[Section titled “vcs.clientKind”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#vcsclientkind)

The kind of client.

Values:

- `"git"`

### `vcs.useIgnoreFile`

[Section titled “vcs.useIgnoreFile”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#vcsuseignorefile)

Whether Biome should use the project’s VCS ignore files. When `true`, Biome will ignore the files
specified in the VCS ignore files as well as those specified in `.ignore` files.

This feature supports nested ignore files too.

The root ignore file yields the same semantics as the root [`files.includes`](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration#filesincludes).

### `vcs.root`

[Section titled “vcs.root”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#vcsroot)

The folder where Biome should check for VCS files. By default, Biome will use the same
folder where `biome.json` was found.

If Biome can’t find the configuration, it will attempt to use the current working directory.
If no current working directory can’t be found, Biome won’t use the VCS integration, and a diagnostic
will be emitted

### `vcs.defaultBranch`

[Section titled “vcs.defaultBranch”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#vcsdefaultbranch)

The main branch of the project. Biome will use this branch when evaluating the changed files.

## `linter`

[Section titled “linter”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#linter)

### `linter.enabled`

[Section titled “linter.enabled”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#linterenabled)

Enables Biome’s linter.

> Default: `true`

### `linter.includes`

[Section titled “linter.includes”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#linterincludes)

A list of [glob patterns](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#glob-syntax-reference) of files to lint.

The following example lints all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```
{

  "linter": {

    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]

  }

}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```
{

  "linter": {

    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js"]

  }

}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are linted, thanks to the `**` pattern…
2. … _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension…
3. … but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still linted.

This means that:

- `src/app.js` **is** linted.
- `src/app.test.js` **is not** linted.
- `src/special.test.js` \* _is_ linted.

Note that `linter.includes` is applied _after_`files.includes`. This means
that any file that is not matched by `files.includes` can no longer be matched
`linter.includes`. This means the following example **doesn’t work**:

```
{

  "files": {

    "includes": "src/**"

  },

  "linter": {

    // This matches nothing because there is no overlap with `files.includes`:

    "includes": "scripts/**"

  }

}
```

If `linter.includes` is not specified, all files matched by
[`files.includes`](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesincludes) are linted.

### `linter.rules.recommended`

[Section titled “linter.rules.recommended”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#linterrulesrecommended)

Enables the recommended rules for all groups.

> Default: `true`

### `linter.rules.[group]`

[Section titled “linter.rules.\[group\]”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#linterrulesgroup)

Options that influence the rules of a single group. Biome supports the following groups:

- accessibility: Rules focused on preventing accessibility problems.
- complexity: Rules that focus on inspecting complex code that could be simplified.
- correctness: Rules that detect code that is guaranteed to be incorrect or useless.
- nursery: New rules that are still under development. Nursery rules require explicit opt-in via configuration on stable versions because they may still have bugs or performance problems. They are enabled by default on nightly builds, but as they are unstable their diagnostic severity may be set to either error or warning, depending on whether we intend for the rule to be recommended or not when it eventually gets stabilized. Nursery rules get promoted to other groups once they become stable or may be removed. Rules that belong to this group are not subject to semantic version.
- performance: Rules catching ways your code could be written to run faster, or generally be more efficient.
- security: Rules that detect potential security flaws.
- style: Rules enforcing a consistent and idiomatic way of writing your code.
- suspicious: Rules that detect code that is likely to be incorrect or useless.

Each group can accept, as a value, a string that represents the severity or an object where each rule can be configured.

When passing the severity, you can control the severity emitted by all the rules that belong to a group.
For example, you can configure the `a11y` group to emit information diagnostics:

```
{

  "linter": {

    "rules": {

      "a11y": "info"

    }

  }

}
```

Here are the accepted values:

- `"on"`: each rule that belongs to the group will emit a diagnostic with the default severity of the rule. Refer to the documentation of the rule, or use the `explain` command:



```
biome explain noDebugger
```

- `"off"`: none of the rules that belong to the group will emit any diagnostics.
- `"info"`: all rules that belong to the group will emit a [diagnostic with information severity](https://biomejs.dev/reference/diagnostics#information).
- `"warn"`: all rules that belong to the group will emit a [diagnostic with warning severity](https://biomejs.dev/reference/diagnostics#warning).
- `"error"`: all rules that belong to the group will emit a [diagnostic with error severity](https://biomejs.dev/reference/diagnostics#error).

### `linter.rules.[group].recommended`

[Section titled “linter.rules.\[group\].recommended”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#linterrulesgrouprecommended)

Enables the recommended rules for a single group.

Example:

```
{

  "linter": {

    "enabled": true,

    "rules": {

      "nursery": {

        "recommended": true

      }

    }

  }

}
```

## `assist`

[Section titled “assist”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#assist)

### `assist.enabled`

[Section titled “assist.enabled”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#assistenabled)

Enables Biome’s assist.

> Default: `true`

### `assist.includes`

[Section titled “assist.includes”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#assistincludes)

A list of [glob patterns](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#glob-syntax-reference) of files to lint.

The following example analyzes all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```
{

  "assist": {

    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]

  }

}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```
{

  "assist": {

    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js"]

  }

}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are analyzed, thanks to the `**` pattern…
2. … _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension…
3. … but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still analyzed.

This means that:

- `src/app.js` **is** analysed.
- `src/app.test.js` **is not** analyzed.
- `src/special.test.js` \* _is_ analyzed.

Note that `assist.includes` is applied _after_`files.includes`. This means
that any file that is not matched by `files.includes` can no longer be matched
`assist.includes`. This means the following example **doesn’t work**:

```
{

  "files": {

    "includes": "src/**"

  },

  "assist": {

    // This matches nothing because there is no overlap with `files.includes`:

    "includes": "scripts/**"

  }

}
```

If `assist.includes` is not specified, all files matched by
[`files.includes`](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesincludes) are linted.

### `assist.actions.recommended`

[Section titled “assist.actions.recommended”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#assistactionsrecommended)

Enables the recommended actions for all groups.

### `assist.actions.[group]`

[Section titled “assist.actions.\[group\]”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#assistactionsgroup)

Options that influence the rules of a single group. Biome supports the following groups:

- source: This group represents those actions that can be safely applied to a document upon saving. These actions are all generally safe, they typically don’t change the functionality of the program.

### `assist.actions.[group].recommended`

[Section titled “assist.actions.\[group\].recommended”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#assistactionsgrouprecommended)

Enables the recommended rules for a single group.

Example:

```
{

  "assist": {

    "enabled": true,

    "actions": {

      "source": {

        "recommended": true

      }

    }

  }

}
```

## `formatter`

[Section titled “formatter”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#formatter)

These options apply to all languages. There are additional language-specific formatting options below.

### `formatter.enabled`

[Section titled “formatter.enabled”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#formatterenabled)

Enables Biome’s formatter.

> Default: `true`

### `formatter.includes`

[Section titled “formatter.includes”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#formatterincludes)

A list of [glob patterns](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#glob-syntax-reference) of files to format.

The following example formats all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```
{

  "formatter": {

    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]

  }

}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```
{

  "formatter": {

    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js"]

  }

}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are formatted, thanks to the `**` pattern…
2. … _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension…
3. … but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still formatted.

This means that:

- `src/app.js` **is** formatted.
- `src/app.test.js` **is not** formatted.
- `src/special.test.js` **is** formatted.

Note that `formatter.includes` is applied _after_`files.includes`. This means
that any file that is not matched by `files.includes` can no longer be matched
`formatter.includes`. This means the following example **doesn’t work**:

```
{

  "files": {

    "includes": "src/**"

  },

  "formatter": {

    // This matches nothing because there is no overlap with `files.includes`:

    "includes": "scripts/**"

  }

}
```

If `formatter.includes` is not specified, all files matched by
[`files.includes`](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesincludes) are formatted.

### `formatter.formatWithErrors`

[Section titled “formatter.formatWithErrors”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#formatterformatwitherrors)

Whether to expand arrays and objects on multiple lines.

- `"auto"`, object literals are formatted on multiple lines if the first property has a newline,
and array literals are formatted on a single line if it fits in the line.
- `"always"`, these literals are formatted on multiple lines, regardless of length of the list.
- `"never"`, these literals are formatted on a single line if it fits in the line.

When formatting `package.json`, Biome will use `always` unless configured otherwise.

> Default: `"auto"`

### `formatter.useEditorconfig`

[Section titled “formatter.useEditorconfig”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#formatteruseeditorconfig)

Whether Biome should use the `.editorconfig` file to determine the formatting options.

The config files `.editorconfig` and `biome.json` will follow the following rules:

- Formatting settings in `biome.json` always take precedence over `.editorconfig` files.
- `.editorconfig` files that exist higher up in the hierarchy than a `biome.json` file are already ignored. This is to avoid loading formatting settings from someone’s home directory into a project with a `biome.json` file.
- Nested `.editorconfig` files aren’t supported currently.

> Default: `false`

## `javascript`

[Section titled “javascript”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#javascript)

## Glob syntax reference

[Section titled “Glob syntax reference”](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#glob-syntax-reference)

Glob patterns are used to match paths of files and folders. Biome supports the
following syntax in globs:

- `*` matches zero or more characters. It cannot match the path separator `/`.
- `**` recursively matches directories and files. This sequence must be used as
an entire path component, so both `**a` and `b**` are invalid and will result
in an error. A sequence of more than two consecutive `*` characters is also
invalid.
- `[...]` matches any character inside the brackets.
Ranges of characters can also be specified, as ordered by Unicode, so e.g.
`[0-9]` specifies any character between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- `[!...]` is the negation of `[...]`, i.e. it matches any characters **not** in
the brackets.
- If the entire glob starts with `!`, it is a so-called negated pattern. This
glob only matches if the path _doesn’t_ match the glob. Negated patterns
cannot be used alone, they can only be used as _exception_ to a regular glob.
- When determining whether a file is included or not, Biome considers the parent
folders too. This means that if you want to _include_ all files in a folder,
you need to use the `/**` suffix to match those files. But if you want to
_ignore_ all files in a folder, you may do so without the `/**` suffix. We
recommend ignoring folders without the trailing `/**`, to avoid needlessly
traversing it, as well as to avoid the risk of Biome loading a `biome.json` or
a `.gitignore` file from an ignored folder.

Some examples:

- `dist/**` matches the `dist/` folder and all files inside it.
- `!dist` ignores the `dist/` folder and all files inside it.
- `**/test/**` matches all files under any folder named `test`, regardless of
where they are. E.g. `dist/test`, `src/test`.
- `**/*.js` matches all files ending with the extension `.js` in all folders.
